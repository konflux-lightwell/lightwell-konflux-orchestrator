    a successful build, producing no Release CR); it is fed to
    :func:`derive_state` so a successful intake counts as terminal success for
    those targets.

    Retry eligibility matches the legacy flat model: with N attempts recorded, a
    failed Request is retriable while ``attempt_count <= max_retries`` (i.e. up to
